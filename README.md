Compress your assignment folder, named with your last name, for example, simkins, containing your index.html, and sketch.js files, creating a .zip file. To create a .zip archive of your assignment folder on a Mac, select the folder and select 'compress [folder name] from the File menu. On a PC, right click on the folder and select 7-Zip from the flyout menu, choose .zip as the archive type from the menu for archive settings. Turn in your assignment by selecting the ‘submit’ button on the assignment description in Canvas. The .zip file should be the same name as the folder, for example, leighton.zip. File folders compressed as in the .rar format will also be accepted.
